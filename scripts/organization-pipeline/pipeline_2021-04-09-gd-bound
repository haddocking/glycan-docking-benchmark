# Entire pipeline for preparing the files for docking (until the tbl file is created). This is for the true-interface runs.
# Run from glycan-docking directory (1 directory above the HADDOCK-ready directory).
# The directory where all the original pdb files are has to be called < HADDOCK-ready > and is found in the glycan-docking directory. 
# The scripts are found in a directory called < scripts > that is also found in the glycan-docking directory.
